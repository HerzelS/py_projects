# CAESAR Cipher

# Caesar cipher. Takes each letter in a message, finds its position in the alphabet,
# takes the letter located after 3 positions in the alphabet,
# and replaces the original letter with the new letter
# Weakness, every single letter is always encrypted with the same letter,
# depending on the specified offset.

# the .find() method finds the position of the first occurance of a string element.
# A method is similar to a function, but it belongs to an object.
